# ✈️ Aircraft Performance Monitor (APM)

A **C-based flight simulation suite**, designed to explore aerospace engineering concepts through software. This project focuses on **real-time monitoring, data logging, and future analysis**, targeting avionics and flight systems development.

---

## 🌍 Overview
This repository contains multiple **phases** of the APM project, each building upon the last to simulate real-world aircraft performance. Starting with basic monitoring, it evolves into data recording and future **analysis tools**.

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`APMPhase_1`** – Real-time flight monitor with automatic phase transitions (takeoff, climb, cruise) and user-controlled throttle.
- **`APMPhase_2`** – Extends Phase 1 with **flight data logging**, simulating aircraft **black boxes**.
- **Future Phases** – Planned expansions include **data visualization, landing simulation, and an advanced physics-based simulator**.

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites
- **Compiler**: GCC (MinGW-w64 via MSYS2, **version 14.2.0 or later**).
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code with the **C/C++ extension** (recommended).
- **Operating System**: Windows (uses `<windows.h>` and `<conio.h>`; adaptable for Linux/Mac with minor modifications).

---

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HasithaErandika/AircraftPerformanceMonitor.git
   cd AircraftPerformanceMonitor
   ```
2. Navigate to individual **phase directories** for specific build and execution instructions.

---

## 🛠️ Usage
Each phase contains its own `apm.c` source file. **Compile and run** the program as detailed in its respective `README.md`.

---

## 🚀 Roadmap
- **Phase 3** – Analyze `flight_log.txt` using **Python** (visualization tools for altitude vs. time graphs).
- **Phase 4** – Add **landing phase** and refine features for portfolio presentation.
- **AAPS** – **Advanced Aircraft Performance Simulator** (separate repository, utilizing C++ and physics-based modeling).

---

## ✈️ Motivation
This project stems from a passion for **aerospace engineering and RC planes**, aligning with industry applications (e.g., **C for avionics at Boeing/Airbus**). It also builds a **strong software foundation** in real-time systems and data analysis.
